## Compute Engine



Google Compute Engine is a core service, offering scalable and flexible virtual machines (VM) instances.



##### **What are Virtual Machines?**

Compute Engine allows you to create and manage virtual machines (also known as Cloud Computing), which are essentially simulated computers that run on powerful hardware. These VMs can be configured with different operating systems, such as Linux or Windows, and come in various predefined machine types with different amounts of CPU and memory to meet your specific computing needs.

There are Hundreds of Uses of Compute Engine and serveral subcomponents of Compute Engine too.

##### **Uses**

**Website Hosting**: You can use Compute Engine to host websites, web applications, and content. It provides scalable and reliable virtual machines to ensure your website is always accessible.

**Application Development**: Developers can create development and testing environments. It allows for easy deployment and scaling of applications during development and testing phases.

**Database Hosting**: It can host databases, including SQL and NoSQL databases, to store and manage your data. It provides reliable storage and backup options.

**Machine Learning**: Google Compute Engine is integrated with Google's AI and machine learning services. You can train machine learning models on powerful VMs and then deploy those models for inference or predictions.

**Game Servers**: Offers low-latency network connections and can scale to accommodate large numbers of players.

**Disaster Recovery**: Allows you to set up disaster recovery solutions by replicating your virtual machine instances to different geographical regions, ensuring data redundancy and availability.

**Content Delivery**: Compute Engine instances can be used as content delivery servers or caching servers to speed up the delivery of web content to users globally.

**IoT (Internet of Things) Data Processing**: Can be used to process and analyze data from IoT devices, providing insights and real-time decision-making capabilities.

**DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Instances can be used to automate development workflows, run build and test environments, and manage CI/CD pipelines efficiently.

**Media Processing**: Media companies can use Compute Engine for video transcoding, rendering, and other media processing tasks, taking advantage of its computational power and scalability.



We will get through them one by one but the gist is that everything on the internet can be done using Compute Engine.
